Group 13's final project is a recipe finder. The user selects a protein (chicken, steak, pork, beef, turkey, or lamb), and then the database is searched for recipes that contain the chosen protein. It has the recipe name, instructions, and ingredients aside from the chosen protein. Node is used to set up and host the app on port 3000, and then React is used to display the information from the SQL database.
